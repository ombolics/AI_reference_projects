All functions are necessary for the code to run properly, please only change the cells that are indicated in the task description.\n","- BLEU-score on the test set should be at least 0.18. Any results below that is a fail in this assignment.\n","- The emphasis of this assignment is on achieving good results as it is required in practical applications. Your hyperparameter choices are the most important decisions you make when training a model. \n","- We have noticed that some students copy already ran cells with outputs of other students. In certain cases, we will rerun the cells to confirm\n","- **Deadline is December 9th.**\n","- Make sure your code can be run from an empty state (use Runtime -> Run all in the menu after restarting the notebook)\n","- Feel free to add more code cells as needed.
